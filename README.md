# My Research in Prime Numbers


Prime numbers are always fun, they are the most mysterious type of numbers in the world of mathematics. Like every other math geek prime numbers also caught my attention. When I was coding a program to find prime numbers, I found that normal algoâ€™s take lot of time to do it. So, I thought why not find an equation. After some surfing on the internet, I found that, it was an age-old riddle. 
My approach is using polynomial curve fitting to approximate a curve that could fit all data points.

So far it was a failure, 

I tried from degree 2 polynomial unto degree 10.

Then I plotted it.

I found the errors of the these curves from the actual values

Next I will try some other methods (Exponential,Log etc)

I will update my results here
